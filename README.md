# Distribution of rights in extended TG-Protection Model

Coursework on the subject of Information Security in computer systems. My specialty is information security

The take-grant protection model is a formal model used in the field of computer security. The model represents a system as directed graph. In my coursework i will distribute rights as much as possible by 7 rules:

**De-jure:** Take, Grant, Create\
**De-facto:** First, Second, Find, Spy, Pass, Post
> I do not need in rule **remove**. All I need is to extend the rights\
> This is possible with the help of rules that create something.
                                      

This model defines **S** - Subjects, **O** - Objects, **R** - rights, where R ∈ {a1,a2,a3} ∪ {t,g}, and **G** - multiple access rights = (S, O, E). **E = O x O x R**
